The overall question to be answered can thus be described as; How does the monetary policy and deposit growth affect the banks’ credit growth in Australia?"

    "text": "Motivation\nThe reason why the objective question is of interest is that banks’ credit plays an important role in the economy as it supports investment for firms, consumption for households, and sometimes causes inflationary pressure. Thus, the effect of monetary policy on credit has been deemed to be an important concern for researchers and central bankers. A channel that explains how monetary policy works through credit is called the credit channel. In the credit channel, changes in monetary policy affect the required reserves of banks, which cause banks to change the quantity of loans they provide (e.g., Bernanke and Blinder (1992); Jimenez et al. 2014). However, the effect of changes in reserves has been estimated to be too small to exert a meaningful influence on bank lending (Woodford 2010).\nOne suggestion to fill this gap is proposed by Dreschler et al. (2017). In the paper, they argue that banks’ credit substantially reacts to monetary policy through changes in deposits. According to their estimation, it accounts for the entire transmission of monetary policy through the bank’s balance sheet. I incorporate this deposit channel in the SVAR framework to evaluate the effect of monetary policy with deposit change on banks’ credit."

The results of the test are displayed in the table below. Across all variables except exchange rate, I cannot not reject the null hypothesis of unit root. It indicates that the time series is non-stationary and requires differencing to achieve stationarity.\n\nTable 1.
