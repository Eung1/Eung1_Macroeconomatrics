The overall question to be answered can thus be described as; How does the monetary policy and deposit growth affect the banks’ credit growth in Australia?"

    "text": "Motivation\nThe reason why the objective question is of interest is that banks’ credit plays an important role in the economy as it supports investment for firms, consumption for households, and sometimes causes inflationary pressure. Thus, the effect of monetary policy on credit has been deemed to be an important concern for researchers and central bankers. A channel that explains how monetary policy works through credit is called the credit channel. In the credit channel, changes in monetary policy affect the required reserves of banks, which cause banks to change the quantity of loans they provide (e.g., Bernanke and Blinder 1992; Jimenez et al. 2014). However, the effect of changes in reserves has been estimated to be too small to exert a meaningful influence on bank lending (Woodford 2010).\nOne suggestion to fill this gap is proposed by Dreschler et al. (2017). In the paper, they argue that banks’ credit substantially reacts to monetary policy through changes in deposits. According to their estimation, it accounts for the entire transmission of monetary policy through the bank’s balance sheet. I incorporate this deposit channel in the SVAR framework to evaluate the effect of monetary policy with deposit change on banks’ credit."

    "text": "The model\nThe structural VAR model with \\(p\\) lags is given by\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n  B_0y_t &= b_0 + B_1 y_{t-1} + \\dots + B_p y_{t-p} + u_t \\\\\n  u_{t}| Y_{t-1} &\\sim {iid} ( 0_N, I_N)\n\\end{align}\n\\] Where \\(B_0\\) is a matrix of contemporaneous relationships, \\(y_t\\) is a vector of endogenous variables, \\(y_{t-1}\\), \\(\\dots\\), \\(y_{t-p}\\) are vectors of lags, and \\(u_t\\) is a vector of independent structural shocks.\n\\(y_t\\) contains eight variables: commodity prices (\\(com_t\\)), the U.S. real GDP (\\(usgdp_t\\)), domestic real GDP (\\(gdp_t\\)), inflation rate(\\(\\pi_t\\)), banks’ credit(\\(c_t\\)), banks’ deposit(\\(d_t\\)), USD exchange rate (\\(ex_t\\)), and cash rate (\\(i_t\\)).\nPremultiplying \\(B_0^{-1}\\) to the structural VAR model gives us the reduced form representation as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n  y_t &= \\mu_0 + A_1 y_{t-1} + \\dots + A_p y_{t-p} + \\epsilon_t \\\\\n  \\epsilon_{t}| Y_{t-1} &\\sim {iid} ( 0_N, \\Sigma)\n\\end{align}\n\\] where \\(A_i=B_0^{-1}B_i\\), \\(\\epsilon_t=B_0^{-1}u_t\\), and \\(\\Sigma=\\)\\(B_0^{-1}B_0^{-1 \\prime}\\)\nUsing the reduced form equations, we can estimate \\(\\Sigma\\). However \\(\\Sigma\\) has \\(8(8+1)/2=36\\) unique elements, which is the number of equations, yet we have \\(8^2=64\\) unknowns in \\(B_0\\). Hence I need to impose exclusion restrictions on \\(B_0\\) to identify the system.\nAssumptions for \\(B_0\\) matrix is as follows:\n\nSince Australian economy is a small open economy, I assume that the domestic variables have no effect on external variables while shocks from the external sector have simultaneous effect on the domestic economy.\nGDP is affected from the external sector but not affected by other domestic variables contemporaneously\nInflation is affected from the external sector and GDP but not affected by other domestic variables contemporaneously.\nCash rate is affected from the external sector, GDP and inflation but not affected by other domestic variables contemporaneously.\nDeposit is affected from the external sector, GDP, inflation, and cash rate but not affected by other domestic variables contemporaneously. I assume that profit maximization motive makes banks to adjust the deposit rate at the same period that RBA adjusts the cash rate. And deposit volume changes accordingly.\nCredit is affected from the external sector, GDP, inflation, cash rate, and deposit but not affected by other domestic variables contemporaneously. Since the deposit is the most stable and major funding source for banks, I assume that banks reduces credit outstanding in response to deposit change.\nThe exchange rate is affected from all variables contemporaneously.\n\nNote that this assumption and thus order of the variables in \\(y_t\\) is subject to change over the course of the research upon any better identification assumption."
